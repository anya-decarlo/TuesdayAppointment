Yes—there are other dataset DOIs and bounding boxes you might consider pulling to enrich your sacred-site HMM pipeline. Here’s a structured list of what should be acquired, why, and the DOI or source to access it.

⸻

✅ PRIMARY LIDAR DATASETS (POINT CLOUDS / ELEVATION)

1. Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project
	•	DOI: 10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1644
	•	What it provides: .laz tiles (~1km²) across Brazilian Amazon (2008–2018)
	•	Why needed: Primary source of LiDAR elevation + canopy structure for Rio Xingu
	•	Bounding box already chosen:
	•	Lat: -11.5° to -10.9°
	•	Lon: -53.5° to -52.9°

✅ You’re already targeting this one — good call.

⸻

✅ SECONDARY: SATELLITE-BASED OBSERVATION ENRICHMENT

2. Sentinel-2 (Copernicus Hub) – [no DOI, but key open source]
	•	What it provides: NDVI, NDWI, BSI, cloud mask
	•	Why: Add vegetation, soil, and moisture features to observation vectors o_t
	•	Scene ID suggestion: Match to same bounding box as LiDAR
	•	Tools:
	•	Sentinel Hub EO Browser
	•	SciHub Copernicus

⸻

✅ TERTIARY: ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE LABELING

3. Cadastro Nacional de Sítios Arqueológicos (CNSA - IPHAN)
	•	Source: IPHAN Geoportal
	•	What it provides: Shapefile of known archaeological sites with:
	•	Coordinates
	•	Site type (e.g. Ceremonial, Residential)
	•	Chronology
	•	Why: Anchor your q_t hidden states where known sites exist
	•	CRS: Usually comes in SIRGAS2000 (EPSG:4674) → reproject to UTM for spatial ops

⸻

✅ OPTIONAL (IF YOU WANT DATING + DEPTH)

4. Brazilian Radiocarbon Database
	•	FAPESP research article source:
Revista Pesquisa Fapesp link
	•	What it provides: 3,769 14C dates from 1,249 sites, including:
	•	Lat/lon
	•	Cultural period (e.g., Archaic, Formative)
	•	Radiocarbon values
	•	Why: Could be used for a temporal extension of HMM or confidence weighting

⸻

✅ ADDITIONAL (TO CONSIDER EXPANDING LATER)

5. GEDI L2A Footprint Data
	•	DOI: 10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2056
	•	What it provides: Canopy structure from NASA’s GEDI laser altimeter
	•	Why: Wider coverage than LiDAR flights; useful for extrapolating features outside dense tiles
