üß¨ How These GeoJSONs Power the HMM:

1. river_segments.geojson = Time Steps t = 1...T

Each 1 km river segment:
	‚Ä¢	Acts as a timestep in the sequence
	‚Ä¢	Is where you‚Äôll extract observations o_t and (if available) infer hidden states q_t

‚û°Ô∏è This file gives your HMM its temporal structure.

2. river_corridor_5km.geojson = Area of Valid Emission Input

This is the buffer zone within which:
	‚Ä¢	LiDAR tiles are considered relevant
	‚Ä¢	Satellite observations (NDVI, etc.) are clipped
	‚Ä¢	IPHAN sites are searched and anchored

You use this to:
	‚Ä¢	Spatially filter which .laz or .tif files intersect your model path
	‚Ä¢	Pre-screen any IPHAN shapefile data for sites inside the valid corridor
