üõ∞Ô∏è 1. LiDAR Data Sources

a. Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project
	‚Ä¢	DOI: 10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1644
	‚Ä¢	Description: Provides LiDAR point cloud data collected over selected forest research sites across the Amazon rainforest in Brazil between 2008 and 2018. The data are provided in 1 km¬≤ tiles and have been georeferenced, noise-filtered, and corrected for misalignment of overlapping flight lines.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Utilize the cms_brazil_lidar_tile_inventory.kmz file to inspect tile coverage in Google Earth and identify tiles aligning with your Rio Xingu corridor.

b. LiDAR and DTM Data from Forested Land Near Manaus
	‚Ä¢	DOI: 10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1515
	‚Ä¢	Description: Offers LiDAR point clouds and digital terrain models (DTM) from surveys over forested areas near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, collected in 2008.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: While not directly over Rio Xingu, this dataset can provide supplementary data for comparative analysis or model training.

üó∫Ô∏è 2. Archaeological Site Data

a. Cadastro Nacional de S√≠tios Arqueol√≥gicos (CNSA) - IPHAN
	‚Ä¢	Source: IPHAN Geoportal
	‚Ä¢	Description: Provides georeferenced data on over 17,500 registered archaeological sites in Brazil, including site coordinates, types, and cultural affiliations.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Use this shapefile to anchor known site types (e.g., Ceremonial_Site, Residential_Cluster) in your HMM. Intersect the IPHAN site locations with your LiDAR-derived segments to label known states.

üåø 3. Supplementary Remote Sensing Data

a. Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
	‚Ä¢	Source: Copernicus Open Access Hub
	‚Ä¢	Description: Provides high-resolution optical imagery useful for calculating vegetation indices like NDVI.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Derive vegetation indices to include in your observation vectors, aiding in distinguishing anthropogenic features from natural vegetation.

b. MODIS Net Radiation and Albedo Data
	‚Ä¢	Source: ORNL DAAC
	‚Ä¢	Description: Offers data on net radiation and albedo for the Xingu River Basin from 2000 to 2012.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Incorporate these variables to understand energy balance dynamics, which may correlate with land use changes indicative of archaeological sites.

üîÑ 4. Integrating Data into HMM
	1.	Define Observation Vectors (o_t):
	‚Ä¢	For each 1 km¬≤ segment along the river corridor, extract features such as:
	‚Ä¢	Terrain elevation and roughness from LiDAR data.
	‚Ä¢	Vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) from Sentinel-2 imagery.
	‚Ä¢	Proximity to water bodies.
	2.	Label Known States (q_t):
	‚Ä¢	Use the IPHAN shapefile to assign known site types to segments where archaeological sites are registered.
	3.	Train HMM:
	‚Ä¢	Utilize the sequences of observation vectors and known states to train your HMM, estimating transition and emission probabilities.
	4.	Predict Unknown States:
	‚Ä¢	Apply the trained HMM to segments without known site labels to predict the likelihood of various site types.

üß∞ 5. Tools and Libraries
	‚Ä¢	Geospatial Processing: geopandas, shapely, rasterio
	‚Ä¢	LiDAR Data Handling: laspy, PDAL
	‚Ä¢	Remote Sensing Analysis: sentinelsat, numpy, scikit-image
	‚Ä¢	HMM Implementation: hmmlearn, pomegranate
