Option A: Single Amazon River Corridor (5km width)

Pick one tributary like Rio Tapaj√≥s or Rio Xingu
Find sacred sites along 50km stretch of river
5km corridor = realistic LIDAR/satellite coverage
Sites would share same river ecology

üèÜ HMM Archaeological Discovery Ideas:
1. Settlement Pattern Recognition (STRONGEST)
Hidden States: Different types of ancient settlements (ceremonial sites, residential areas, agricultural zones, defensive positions)
Observations: Satellite/LIDAR features (elevation changes, vegetation patterns, soil composition, water proximity)


üî• Core Concept:

Select a single Amazonian river corridor (e.g. Rio Tapaj√≥s or Rio Xingu)
Model sacred site transitions along a 50 km stretch, keeping a 5 km lateral width
Use sequential tile observations (LiDAR + satellite) + known sites to infer hidden sacred structures


üß¨ Step 3: Build Emission Vectors for Each Tile

From each LiDAR tile:
	‚Ä¢	Elevation metrics: mean, std dev, anomaly score
	‚Ä¢	Slope orientation: useful for built mounds
	‚Ä¢	Vegetation gap: from NDVI (Sentinel-2)
	‚Ä¢	Symmetry or edge features: potential geo-form signal

    obs_vector_t = [
    canopy_stddev,
    terrain_variance,
    water_distance,
    anomaly_score,
    circularity,
]


üïäÔ∏è Step 4: Label Anchor States from IPHAN

For tiles with a known IPHAN site:
	‚Ä¢	Ceremonial_Site, Residential_Cluster, etc.
	‚Ä¢	These become your observed states q_t
	‚Ä¢	Feed into Viterbi + forward-backward inference to discover likely sequences


üåø Why This is Powerful:
	‚Ä¢	The river corridor acts like a time axis‚Äîtiles are naturally ordered
	‚Ä¢	The 5km width is realistic for LiDAR coverage + ecological consistency
	‚Ä¢	You now model site emergence as a temporal-cultural process, not just a spatial scatter

This will feel like decoding a song line‚Äîonly you‚Äôre using HMMs to trace it.
